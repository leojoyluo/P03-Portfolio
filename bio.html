        <p id="bio">I am in SIAT major and concentrated in Media arts in SFU. I found I was interested in media arts when I was in secondary school, I was interested in watching videos especially 3D animations. After that, I start to learn some  and photographing in spare time. Then I decide to learn more professional animating skills in the university and endue art technique including aesthetics and design principles so I came here. After I studied here for four years, I wish I can be an animator even an animation designer. <a href="#contact_us">Know More About Me </a></p>
