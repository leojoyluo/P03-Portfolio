I found I was interested in media arts when I was in secondary school, I was interested in watching videos especially 3D animations. After that, I start to learn some  and photographing in spare time. Then I decide to learn more professional animating skills in the university and endue art technique including aesthetics and design principles so I came here. After I studied here for four years, I wish I can be an animator even an animation designer. <a href="#container2">Know More About My Project </a>

  <h1 id="employ-heading">Employment Interest</h1>
        <p id="interest">I am interesed in working in the field of animation and animation design. The animation designer of Loreal company is responsible for the product design for mass production which need the designer to be observant, careful. The animation designer needs to do the animation of the advertisement for the product, the design of the product inside. We need the qualification of the position is that, the undergraduate or graduate degree or diploma of related majors or concentrate in university or college.  If the employers have any other experiences relate to the position, this might be helpful.   Loreal is one of the biggest daily chemical company in the world, they have a lot of brands such as Lancome, Shu Uemura，Armani Beauty. They have lots of products and advertisement, so the animation designers are what they need and seeking, with a better animation to illustrate their product, it will be much easier for the viewers/customer to accept.

          <p>The work I chose is an individual project from IAT 343 Animation. The uppermost purpose of the project is to lead people to the world of 3D animation from modeling, analyze how a model been built in steps, then combining our own understanding of it and creativity to create our own models.

                  <h2>Project Description</h2>
                  <p class="pjt-des">The goal of this work is to establish basic animating skills on modeling in 3D animation to express a sense we want to create. For me, I plan to create an object with a punctum.  Punctum is something that could stimulate audiences, it could be an emotion. What I created is my first animation model, a flower pot and some fake flowers. What I have done to try to achieve the goal can be found from the idea, the process of modeling and the decision of composition of all models. </p>

                  <p class="pjt-des">The first step of this project, ideating, I camp up with the idea of  comparing real flower and fake flowers near a window. I created two kinds of flowers’ models for this project, one is growing potted white flowers, the other is a dry colorful flower. I would create a sense of a comparison between alive and dead flowers.</p>

          <p>The work I chose is another individual project from IAT 343 Animation. The uppermost purpose of the project is to challenge people to create, creating our first environment in the world of 3D animation through 3D MAYA, analyze what objects do we need to create an environment with a subject holding it, then bring it into parts, create them step by step.</p>
